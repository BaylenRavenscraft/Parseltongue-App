#First, we'll define a Lesson class to represent a lesson in the app. Each lesson will have a list of vocabulary words to learn, and a list of sentences to translate. We'll also define a method to check whether the user has completed the lesson: 

class Lesson:
    def __init__(self, vocabulary, sentences):
        self.vocabulary = vocabulary
        self.sentences = sentences
        self.completed = False
    
    def check_completion(self):
        # Check if the user has correctly completed all vocabulary and translation exercises
        pass
