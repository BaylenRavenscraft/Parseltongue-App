# Next, we'll define a Mode class to represent a mode in the app, such as a lesson mode or a practice mode. Each mode will have a list of lessons, and a method to move to the next lesson: 

class Mode:
    def __init__(self, lessons):
        self.lessons = lessons
        self.current_lesson_index = 0
    
    def next_lesson(self):
        # Move to the next lesson
        self.current_lesson_index += 1
