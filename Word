# Now, let's define a Word class to represent a vocabulary word in the matching game minigame. Each word will have a value (the word in the source language) and a translation: 

class Word:
    def __init__(self, value, translation):
        self.value = value
        self.translation = translation
        self.matched = False
    
    def match(self, translation):
        # Check if the given translation matches the word's translation
        return self.translation == translation
