# Finally, we'll define a LanguageApp class to represent the overall language-learning app. The app will have a list of modes, and a method to switch between them:

class LanguageApp:
    def __init__(self, modes):
        self.modes = modes
        self.current_mode_index = 0
    
    def switch_mode(self, mode_index):
        # Switch to the specified mode
        self.current_mode_index = mode_index



# Here's how you might use these classes to create a language-learning app:

# Define some vocabulary and sentences for the lessons
vocab_lesson_1 = ['hello', 'goodbye']
sentences_lesson_1 = ['Hello, how are you?', 'Goodbye, see you later']
vocab_lesson_2 = ['apple', 'banana']
sentences_lesson_2 = ['I like apples', 'I like bananas']

# Create the lessons
lesson_1 = Lesson(vocab_lesson_1, sentences_lesson_1)
lesson_2 = Lesson(vocab_lesson_2, sentences_lesson_2)

# Create a mode with the lessons
lesson_mode = Mode([lesson_1, lesson_2])

# Create a practice mode with no lessons (the user can choose which vocabulary and sentences to practice)
practice_mode = Mode([])

# Create the language-learning app with the two modes
app = LanguageApp([lesson_mode, practice_mode])

# Switch to the practice mode
app.switch_mode(1)
